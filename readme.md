# Delaware Court 
## Web Scraping Challenge

## Getting started:

This is a web scrapping tool that can help us retrieve records from https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/cc/cconnect/ck_public_qry_main.cp_main_idx

## Libraries used:

- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pymongo
- Fake_useragent
- Python Virtual Env
- Scraperapi_sdk

## Running commands:

- Create env: python3 -m venv env
- Activate env source/env/bin/activate
- Install libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Build Docker environment: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
- Execute scraping: python3 main.py

## Architecture:
The project is divided in three core files.
#### 1. fetcher.py takes care of sending requests to the website and return responses that will be processed later
#### 2. parser.py processes the information inside the response and returns catalogue results / records information
#### 3. main.py functions as a sort of task manager where we iterate over search results, pages and such.
#### 4. client.py that specifies headers information and sets the scrape_api proxy for future requests

The order is the following:
1. Info is sended as parameter inside the body of the GET request to the website specifying info such as:
    - First name
    - Last name
    - Phonetic search
    - Case beginning date
    - Case finishing date
    - Page of records retrieved
    - etc.

2. We get the response with the results, where different people's records appear and iterate over them visiting each case and retrieving every case record.

Put simply: this scraper follows the browsing routine of a normal person. There could be some discussion as to whether making all requests first and then parse all the data could be useful but I find to be riskier and more suspicious for the server to receive concurrent requests rapidly. I opted to add some concurrency with 2-4 workers that walk all the path described.

### More resources:
1. test.log -> all logging information is processed here.
2. json file is a sample of 10 pages with about 200 documents.

### Notes:
I chose bs4 and requests as libraries since I needed a lot of freedom to parse the html and process the information. Scrapy xpath functions were not consistent with data results (website html was not very friendly to being scraped). I implemented proxy rotation with the scraper_api sdk and the whole process is records itself logs file.

This scraper can work for example with a txt file that has a list of people whose info will be needed as parameters for the query builder in main.py.

### Json output sample:
